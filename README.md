**EazyTender Project Breakdown**

EazyTender is a tender management system where BUYERS can publish tenders and VENDORS have access to an extensive collection of business tenders and leads from all levels of private and public sectors in Nigeria.

**This product has two main users:**

**Buyer:** This user persona could be a private or government agency. The buyer performs the following functions:
-   Creates and upload tender documents
    
-   Verify Vendors behind the scene.
    
-   Accept or decline vendors interest on bids.
    
-   Creates criteria to award contract
    
-   Awards contract on the platform
    
**Vendor:** This user persona could be a private company or consultant. The vendor shows interest in a tender advert, views the buyer profile, uploads necessary documents for the proposal and watch the progress of the submitted bid. The vendor has the will to accept or decline a closed bid and can apply to various adverts as long as it pertains to its industry.
